#### Post Title
"Career Intelligence - The system I used to land a $210k Google PM role"

#### Tagline
"Job tracking, salary intelligence, and AI coaching for tech careers"

#### Description (280 chars)
```
Most people track their career in spreadsheets. I built a system that got me from Microsoft to Google. Now it's a product.

Track jobs, get salary data, negotiate better, and get AI coaching from a Google PM.
```

#### First Comment (Founder Story)
```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Oliver, a PM at Google (previously Microsoft). Over the years, I built a system for managing my career that helped me:
- Track 100+ job opportunities without losing any
- Negotiate a $210k offer at Google
- Make strategic career moves (not random jumps)

Friends kept asking for my spreadsheets and process. So I turned it into a product.

Career Intelligence gives you:
✅ Smart job tracker (better than spreadsheets)
✅ Real salary data (know your worth)
✅ AI career coach (trained on tech careers)
✅ Offer analyzer (compare & negotiate)

I'm launching early access today. Would love your feedback!

What's your biggest career tracking pain point?

### 2. HackerNews (Show HN)
**Status:** Draft only

#### Title
"Show HN: Career Intelligence – My system for going from Microsoft to Google"

#### Post
```
Hi HN,

I'm a PM at Google. Before that, Microsoft. I spent years refining a system for managing my career strategically (not randomly).

The system helped me:
- Keep track of opportunities without spreadsheet hell
- Know my market value (salary intelligence)
- Negotiate better offers ($210k at Google)
- Make intentional career moves

I built it into a product: [URL]

It's early access right now. Free tier available.

Stack: Next.js, Supabase, OpenAI API for the career coach

Would love feedback from the HN community. What do you use to track your career? (Most people say "memory" or "Gmail search" 😅)
```

Hey everyone,

I see a lot of posts here about job tracking, offer negotiation, and career progression. Thought I'd share what worked for me.

I'm currently a PM at Google (previously Microsoft). Over the years I built a system for managing my career that includes:

1. Job tracking (way better than spreadsheets)
2. Salary intelligence (real comp data)
3. Offer comparison (side-by-side analysis)
4. AI career coach (trained on tech careers)

Used this exact system to negotiate my $210k Google offer.

I turned it into a product recently: [URL]

Free tier available if you want to try it. Happy to answer questions about the system or tech careers in general.

What do you all use for job tracking?
```

#### r/ProductManagement
**Title:** "How I tracked my way from Microsoft PM to Google PM"

```
As PMs, we're supposed to be data-driven. But how many of us track our own careers that way?

I built a system over 5+ years that helped me:
- Track 100+ opportunities systematically
- Make strategic career moves (not reactive)
- Negotiate a $210k offer at Google
- Always know my market value

Just launched it as a product: [URL]

Includes job tracking, salary intelligence, and AI career coaching.

Would love feedback from other PMs. How do you manage your career data?
```

### 4. LinkedIn Post
**Status:** Draft for Oliver's approval

```
I spent 5 years building a career intelligence system.

Used it to go from Microsoft to Google. Negotiate a $210k PM offer. Make strategic career moves instead of random job hops.

Friends kept asking for my spreadsheets. So I built a product instead.

Introducing Career Intelligence: 🧠

✅ Job tracker (finally, better than spreadsheets)
✅ Salary intelligence (know what you're worth)
✅ AI career coach (get advice from a Google PM)
✅ Offer analyzer (compare & negotiate with data)

Early access is open: [URL]

Free tier available. Pro tier is $49/month (or $399/year).

Thread 1/10 🧵

I built a career intelligence system that got me from Microsoft to Google.

Here's the system (and yes, it's now a product):

---

2/10

Most people track their career in:
• Random spreadsheets
• Browser bookmarks  
• Gmail search
• Their memory

This is why people make bad career moves.

---

3/10

I spent 5 years refining a system that gave me:

📊 Complete visibility into opportunities
💰 Real salary intelligence
🎯 Strategic career moves (not random)
🤝 Better negotiation leverage

Result: $210k PM offer at Google

---

4/10

The system has 4 core components:

1. Job Tracker
Track every opportunity. Never lose a lead. Know exactly where you are in each process.

(Better than spreadsheets, I promise)

---

5/10

2. Salary Intelligence

Know what you're worth. See real comp data. Compare offers side-by-side.

I used this to negotiate +$40k at Google.

---

6/10

3. AI Career Coach

Get advice from someone who's done it (me).

Trained on tech careers. Not generic ChatGPT advice.

Resume feedback, interview prep, career strategy.

---

7/10

4. Offer Analyzer

Comparing offers is hard. Base salary, equity, bonus, location, growth...

This breaks it down clearly. Shows total comp. Factors in everything.

---

8/10

I turned this system into a product: [URL]

Early access is open.

Free tier: Track 10 jobs, basic salary data
Pro: $49/month - unlimited everything

---

9/10

Why did I build this?

Because I kept seeing smart people make bad career moves due to lack of data.

You wouldn't ship a product without analytics. Why run your career that way?
