# Career Growth Roadmap: From Individual Contributor to Director (Real Salary Data)

People ask me: "How do I get to the top?"

The answer is boring. It's not about luck. It's not about being the smartest person in the room. It's about understanding the roadmap and executing it deliberately.

Here's the career progression path I've seen work 100+ times, with real salary data for each stage.

## The 5 Levels of Career Progression

### Level 1: Individual Contributor (IC1/IC2)

**Title Examples:** Associate, Coordinator, Analyst, Engineer I  
**Experience:** 0-2 years  
**Median Salary (US Tech):** $80K-120K  
**Stock/Equity:** Minimal

**What You Do:**
- Execute tasks assigned by your manager
- Learn the domain
- Build foundational skills
- Get trained

**How Long:** 1-2 years

**What Success Looks Like:**
- You can complete projects independently
- You don't need supervision on routine tasks
- Your code/work quality is good

**Common Trap:** You get comfortable and stay here for 5+ years. Organizations love keeping good ICs. They'll give you raises to keep you.

---

### Level 2: Senior IC (IC3/IC4)

**Title Examples:** Senior Engineer, Senior PM, Senior Analyst  
**Experience:** 3-6 years  
**Median Salary (US Tech):** $150K-230K  
**Stock/Equity:** Significant (especially at FAANG)

**What You Do:**
- Own projects end-to-end
- Mentor junior ICs
- Set quality standards for your team
- Influence direction

**How Long:** 3-5 years

**What Success Looks Like:**
- You can lead a project from concept to launch
- Others ask you for advice
- You've shipped something that moved the needle
- You can articulate the "why" behind decisions

**Common Trap:** You get really good at this level and managers don't want to promote you (you're too valuable in current role). Push back. You're ready to level up.

---

### Level 3: Transitional Role (IC5/Lead/Staff)

**Title Examples:** Lead Engineer, Staff Engineer, Principal Engineer, Group PM, Senior Product Manager  
**Experience:** 7-10 years  
**Median Salary (US Tech):** $250K-400K  
**Stock/Equity:** Very significant

**What You Do:**
- Own the technical or strategic direction
- Influence multiple teams
- Make architectural decisions
- Define standards and best practices

**How Long:** 2-4 years

**What Success Looks Like:**
- You've influenced multiple teams (not just your immediate team)
- You've owned something bigger than a single project
- You've mentored multiple senior ICs
- You're known for something specific (scalability, strategy, security, etc.)

**Common Trap:** You plateau here. Very few people go beyond this level. If you want to go higher, you need to demonstrate people leadership, not just technical excellence.

---

### Level 4: Manager (M1/M2)

**Title Examples:** Manager, Engineering Manager, Product Manager (in matrix org), Senior Manager  
**Experience:** 8-15 years (typically)  
**Median Salary (US Tech):** $200K-300K  
**Stock/Equity:** Very significant (+ RSU packages often increase)

**What You Do:**
- Manage people (usually 4-12)
- Set team direction
- Make hiring/firing decisions
- Own team OKRs

**How Long:** 3-5 years

**What Success Looks Like:**
- Your team is high-performing
- You've hired and developed senior people
- Your team ships on time and quality is good
- You have good relationships across the org

**Common Trap:** You get promoted because you're a great IC, but you hate managing people. Or you're a great manager but people think you should have technical depth. This is a transition role. It's different.

**Real Talk:** Some of the best people never become managers and that's fine. If you want the IC track to continue, go for Staff Engineer instead.

---

### Level 5: Director

**Title Examples:** Director of Engineering, VP Product, Head of [Function]  
**Experience:** 12-20 years (typically)  
**Median Salary (US Tech):** $250K-500K  
**Stock/Equity:** Very significant (+ sometimes bonus structures)

**What You Do:**
- Manage multiple teams
- Set org-level direction
- Own P&L or major initiatives
- Make strategic decisions affecting the company

**How Long:** 3-5 years

**What Success Looks Like:**
- You manage multiple managers
- Your decisions affect company direction
- You've scaled an organization through significant growth
- You're thinking about 3-5 year vision

## How to Progress: The Actual Roadmap

### Getting From Level 1 to Level 2 (0-3 years)

**Timeline:** 18-24 months

**What Matters:**
1. **Shipping stuff.** Not prototype-y stuff. Real, shipped features/products
2. **Code/work quality.** Be the person everyone wants to work with
3. **Learning fast.** Pick things up quickly, don't need hand-holding
4. **Taking initiative.** Find problems and solve them without being asked

**How to Accelerate:**
- Find a mentor at Level 3+ (someone you can learn from)
- Volunteer for hard projects (the ones others avoid)
- Document what you learn (blog posts, internal wikis)
- Ask for feedback constantly

**The Conversation:**
"I'd like to be promoted to Senior IC. Here's what I've shipped: [list]. Here's the impact: [numbers]. I'm ready to own full projects."

---

### Getting From Level 2 to Level 3 (3-8 years)

**Timeline:** 2-3 years

**What Matters:**
1. **Scope.** You need to demonstrate impact beyond your immediate team
2. **Leadership.** Mentor junior ICs. Own the team's direction
3. **Influence.** Change how others think about problems
4. **Strategic thinking.** See the bigger picture

**How to Accelerate:**
- Take on cross-team projects (this is where you prove scope)
- Mentor 2-3 junior engineers explicitly
- Write architectural docs or strategies
- Present at company tech talks
- Be known for something (reliability? scale? security?)

**The Conversation:**
"I'm ready for the next level. I've been leading [cross-team project]. I've mentored [people]. I've influenced [outcome]. What's the path to Staff Engineer/Principal?"

---

### Getting From Level 3 to Level 4/5 (8-15 years)

**Timeline:** 1-2 years of intentional work

**The Fork:** Here's where you decide: IC track or Management track?

**IC Track to Level 4+ (Principal/Distinguished Engineer):**
- Continue technical excellence
- Increase influence across org
- Own critical infrastructure/strategy
- Be the expert people seek out

**Management Track to Level 4+ (Manager/Director):**
- Transition to managing people (if you haven't)
- Develop your team
- Set clear direction
- Build trust across teams

**How to Accelerate:**
- Make the decision clear to your manager (I want to go management / I want to stay IC)
- If management: take on a small team lead role first
- If IC: own something bigger/harder than you're currently doing
- Build relationships with your skip-level manager (their boss)

---

## The Unspoken Rules (Nobody Tells You These)

### 1. **Title changes matter more than you think**

When you're interviewing for a job, your current title matters. A lot.

- "Senior Engineer" can go to many companies as "Senior" or "Staff"
- "Engineer" applying for "Senior" role? Harder sell, even if you're equally skilled

So when you negotiate your promotion title, negotiate the actual level too.

### 2. **You need a sponsor**

Promotions don't happen because you're good. They happen because someone in power advocates for you.

Get a sponsor. Find someone 2 levels above you who believes in you. Them promoting you is 10x more credible than you promoting yourself.

### 3. **The promotion cycle matters**

Most companies promote quarterly or annually. Know your company's cycle. Plan accordingly.

If promotions happen in March, have your case built by January.

### 4. **Stock vesting happens over 4 years**

If you get promoted and get a big stock package, it vests over 4 years (usually). That means:
- Don't leave year 1 (you're leaving a ton of money)
- Don't stay if you hate it (you're leaving money anyway, might as well get new equity at a new company)
- Plan your moves in 3-year chunks

### 5. **Salary compression is real**

If you get promoted but stay at the company, your raise often sucks because they anchor off your current salary.

If you leave the company and come back in a higher role, you can re-negotiate everything.

This is why some people job-hop. Not always pretty, but it's real.

## Real Example: The $80K → $350K Path

Let me trace a real career path:

**2012 - Age 22 - Junior Engineer**
- Salary: $85K
- Company: Startup (Series A)
- Role: Backend engineer

**2014 - Age 24 - Senior Engineer** 
- Salary: $140K
- Company: Same startup (Series B)
- Stock value: ~$60K
- **2-year progression**

**2016 - Age 26 - Staff Engineer**
- Salary: $220K  
- Company: Google
- Stock value: ~$150K
- **2-year jump (job change)**

**2019 - Age 29 - Senior Staff Engineer**
- Salary: $310K
- Company: Google
- Stock value: ~$200K
- **3-year progression**

**2022 - Age 32 - Director of Engineering**
- Salary: $380K
- Company: New startup (Series B, higher equity)
- Stock value: ~$150K (new equity package)
- **3-year jump (job change)**

**2024 - Age 34 - VP Engineering**
- Salary: $450K
- Company: Same startup
- Stock value: ~$400K (company appreciated)
- **2-year progression**

**Total: $85K → $850K total comp in 12 years**

This person:
1. Moved jobs 2x when stagnant
2. Stayed 3 years at places they were growing
3. Got sponsors/mentors at each step
4. Built specific expertise (backend scalability)
5. Made deliberate choices

## The Career Math

Here's what actually matters:

**Salary growth = (Starting salary) × (Annual raise %) ^ (Years)**

If you get 3% annual raises: 12 years = 42% total growth.

If you job-jump every 2-3 years (get 15-20% bump each time): 12 years = 200%+ total growth.

**This is why job-hopping tends to pay better than staying.**

Controversial, but true.

## What to Do This Week

1. **Figure out your level.** Are you IC1, IC2, IC3? Management?
2. **Figure out your next level.** What does success look like?
3. **Talk to your manager.** "What do I need to do to get to [next level]?"
4. **Find a mentor** at that level or above. Ask them how they got there.
5. **Get the salary data.** Use Levels.fyi, Blind, Comparably. Know the market.
6. **Plan your 3-year move.** What company? What role? What trajectory?

If you're at a company that doesn't have a clear path, start interviewing. You'll learn what you're worth.
