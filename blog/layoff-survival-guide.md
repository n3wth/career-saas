You just got the news. Your company is laying off 20% of staff. Your role is being eliminated.

Your first instinct: panic.

Your second instinct: update your resume and LinkedIn.

Both are wrong. Before you do anything, take a breath. You're in a stronger position than you think.

This guide is your playbook for navigating a layoff. Not just surviving it, but using it as a catalyst for the best career move you've made.

## The Immediate 48 Hours

### Hour 1: Get Your Documents

Before you leave that meeting, get clarity on:
- Severance package (how much, how long)
- Extended benefits (health insurance, 401k)
- References (who can you list as a reference?)
- Final paycheck (when will it arrive?)
- Vesting (do you keep your equity?)

**Write this down.** You're in shock. You won't remember details.

### Hour 2-4: Notify Your Trusted Advisors

Not LinkedIn. Not Twitter. Tell:
- Your spouse/partner
- Your closest friends
- Your mentor (if you have one)

Why? You'll need emotional support and good counsel. Get it from trusted people first.

### Hour 4-24: Don't Do Anything Public Yet

Resist the urge to:
- Post about the layoff on LinkedIn
- Email your network
- Update your resume
- Start applying to jobs

Why? You're emotional. You'll second-guess yourself. Wait.

### Hour 24-48: Assess Your Situation

Answer these questions:
1. **Financial runway:** How many months can you survive without income?
   - Calculate: (Savings + Severance) / (Monthly expenses)
   - Example: ($100K + $50K severance) / $5K expenses = 30 months
   
2. **Desired timeline:** How soon do you need to work?
   - 0-3 months (urgent): You need a job now
   - 3-6 months (moderate): You can be selective
   - 6+ months (flexible): You can explore options, sabbatical, learning

3. **Values check:** What matters most in your next role?
   - Salary/security?
   - Impact/mission?
   - Work-life balance?
   - Learning/growth?
   - Something else?

Your answers here will guide everything that follows.

## Financial Strategy (Before You Do Anything Else)

This is unsexy, but it's the foundation of your negotiation power.

### Calculate Your True Runway

```
Cash on Hand: $______
Severance: $______
Spouse Income (if any): $______/month
Total Available: $______

Monthly Expenses: $______
Children: $______
Housing: $______
Food: $______
Other: $______
Total Monthly: $______

Months of Runway: Total Available / Monthly = ______
```

If runway is 6+ months, you have negotiation power. You can wait for the right opportunity. You can negotiate harder.

If runway is 1-3 months, you're on a clock. You need a job sooner.

### Optimize Your Burn Rate (Temporarily)

If runway is tight, reduce expenses for 6 months:
- Pause streaming subscriptions
- Reduce dining out
- Delay large purchases
- Consider a second income (freelance, gig work)

This buys you months of runway. Months = leverage.

### Talk to a Tax Professional

Layoffs have tax implications:
- Severance might be taxable
- Unemployent insurance is available
- You might need to make estimated tax payments
- A professional can save you thousands

## Telling Your Story

Before you job search, you need a story.

Not "I was laid off." But **why you're excited about what's next.**

### The Bad Story

"My company laid off 20% of staff. My role was cut. I'm looking for a new opportunity."

This is sad. Weak. Makes you sound like a victim.

### The Good Story

"I was part of a restructuring at [Company]. It was the right move for the company given market conditions. During my time there, I built [accomplishment]. Now I'm excited about [next chapter] and looking to bring that experience to [type of role]."

This shows:
- You understand business reality
- You're not bitter
- You have accomplishments to show
- You know what you want next

### Build Your 30-Second Elevator Pitch

Practice saying this out loud (you'll use it a thousand times):

"I was at [Company] for [duration] where I [main accomplishment]. In the recent restructuring, my role was eliminated. I'm now looking for [type of role] where I can [value you bring]. Specifically interested in [industry/type of company]."

The key: Lead with accomplishment, acknowledge layoff without dwelling on it, pivot to what's next.

## The Job Search Strategy

### The First 2 Weeks: Personal Outreach

Do NOT start applying to jobs yet.

Start with your network:
- Email 20 people you've worked with or know
- Say: "I'm exploring my next role. Would love to chat for 20 minutes?"
- Mention 2-3 things you'd be interested in
- Ask for referrals to companies/people

**Why this works:**
- Referral-based jobs are filled 2x faster
- You have information advantage (insider perspective before you apply)
- Network feels invested in your success

**Template email:**

```
Hi [Name],

Hope you're well! I wanted to reach out because we worked together at [Company] and I respected your perspective on [something specific].

I recently was part of a restructuring and my role was eliminated. I'm exploring my next opportunity and would love to get your thoughts on some ideas I'm exploring.

Would you have 20 minutes in the next week for a quick call? I'm interested in [2-3 specific types of roles/companies].

Also, if you think of anyone I should talk to, I'd appreciate an intro.

Thanks!
[Name]
```

### Weeks 2-4: Apply to 5-10 Positions

Only after personal outreach, start applying.

Focus on:
- Referral-based opportunities (referred by someone)
- Jobs that match your skills closely (80%+ match)
- Companies you actually want to work for

Avoid:
- Applying to 100 jobs (spreads you too thin)
- Jobs you're "kind of" interested in (pursue what excites you)
- Applying without any connection (much lower response rate)

### Weeks 4-8: Interview Process

You'll likely be interviewing with 2-3 companies simultaneously. This is good leverage.

**Pro tips:**
- Be honest about timeline ("I'm exploring options; happy to move quickly if it's right")
- Ask about team/product (you're evaluating them too)
- Don't badmouth previous company
- Emphasize specific accomplishments with metrics

## Salary Negotiation

This is where you can recoup the "lost" severance and more.

### Know Your Number

Research salary for your role:
- Levels.fyi
- Blind Community
- Salary.com
- LinkedIn (check peer profiles)

Determine:
- Market rate for your experience: $150K (example)
- Minimum acceptable: $140K
- Stretch goal: $170K

### The Negotiation Script

When they ask "What salary are you looking for?":

**Never** answer with a number first.

Instead: "I'm flexible on compensation if the role is right. I'm more interested in learning about the role and team. That said, based on market rates for similar roles, I'd expect something in the range of $150-170K. What's your budget?"

**Why this works:**
- You establish floor ($150K minimum)
- You don't anchor too low
- You ask them to reveal their range
- You stay flexible (shows you care about fit, not just money)

### Negotiating Other Elements

If salary is fixed, negotiate:
- Stock options (can be worth more than cash)
- Sign-on bonus (immediate cash)
- Remote flexibility
- Extra PTO
- Learning budget
- Title

## Turning Layoff Into Leverage

Here's the secret most people miss: Layoffs give you permission to make big changes.

### Permission to Change Careers

"I was a software engineer for 8 years. I always wanted to try product management. The layoff gave me the push to explore it."

Recruiters understand this. This is actually a great time to pivot.

### Permission to Negotiate Harder

When you have a job offer and 6 months of runway, you can negotiate:
- "I'd like to negotiate salary."
- "I'd prefer remote."
- "I want to start in 4 weeks (time to take a break)."

Most employed people can't negotiate these things. Laid-off people can.

### Permission to Be Selective

You don't have to take the first offer. You can wait for the right one.

### Permission to Take a Break

If you have 6+ months of runway, consider taking 4-8 weeks off:
- Recharge
- Learn something new
- Travel
- Reflect on what you actually want

This isn't laziness. This is strategic. You'll interview better after a break.

## Conclusion

Layoffs suck. But they're also opportunities.

**The companies that win after layoffs:**
1. Take a breath (don't panic)
2. Assess finances (know their runway)
3. Tell a good story (don't dwell on the past)
4. Activate network (get referrals)
5. Be selective (choose good opportunities)
6. Negotiate (you have leverage)
7. Move forward

Most people do 1-3. The best do all 7.

You're in a better position than you think. Now act like it.
