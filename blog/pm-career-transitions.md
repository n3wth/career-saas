## The IC to Manager Transition

The biggest leap is from Senior PM to Group PM (managing other PMs).

### Why It's Hard

You're used to shipping features. Now you're shipping people.

You're used to saying "Let's do X." Now you're saying "Let's decide as a team what we should do."

You have less time for hands-on PM work. You have more time in meetings.

### What Changes

**Time allocation:**

As Senior PM (IC):
- 70% product work (research, roadmap, strategy)
- 20% meetings (standups, stakeholder alignment)
- 10% admin

As Group PM (Manager):
- 30% strategic product work
- 40% managing/coaching your team
- 20% stakeholder alignment
- 10% admin

### What You Need to Learn

1. **Coaching:** How to help PMs grow
2. **Delegation:** How to trust others with decisions you'd make yourself
3. **Hiring:** How to build a strong team
4. **Feedback:** How to give constructive, actionable feedback
5. **Conflict resolution:** How to mediate PM disagreements
6. **Vision setting:** How to align your team around a shared direction

### Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Trying to do both**
You're managing a team of 3 PMs, but you're also owning a product area hands-on.

This doesn't work. You'll be mediocre at both.

**Better:** Pick one. If you're managing, focus 80% on managing. Don't try to be a contributor and manager.

**Mistake 2: Not letting go**
You want to review every decision your team makes.

This kills their growth and frustrates them.

**Better:** Set direction. Let them own execution. Review outcomes, not decisions.

**Mistake 3: Avoiding hard conversations**
One of your PMs isn't performing. You keep hoping they'll improve.

They won't. Hoping is not management.

**Better:** Have the conversation. Either they improve with support, or they move on.

## Preparing for the IC-to-Manager Transition

### 1. Start Managing Before You Officially Transition

- Mentor a junior PM (even without formal authority)
- Volunteer to do hiring for product
- Lead a cross-functional initiative
- Coach someone on a hard decision

### 2. Get Honest Feedback

Ask your manager:
- "What would it take to move to a manager role?"
- "Where are my gaps?"
- "Who should I talk to?"

### 3. Find a Manager Mentor

Ideally someone who was an IC PM and is now managing. Learn from their journey.

### 4. Read Management Books

- "The Coaching Habit" by Michael Bungay Stanier
- "Radical Candor" by Kim Scott
- "The Manager's Path" by Camille Fournier

### 5. Take a Management Course

Consider a structured course (Reforge, Maven, etc.). You'll learn frameworks and practice with others in transition.

## The Specialist vs. Generalist Path

Not everyone wants to manage. And that's okay.

**The Specialist Path:**
You stay IC, but go deeper in a domain.

Example: You focus specifically on monetization, pricing, or international expansion. You become world-class at that thing.

**Advantages:**
- More hands-on work (you like shipping)
- Higher depth (you become an expert)
- Less management overhead
- Typically still high pay (you're rare)

**Disadvantages:**
- Company growth caps your leverage
- Opportunity is narrower
- Can feel less important (you're not managing people)

**Typical progression:**
Senior PM → Principal PM / Distinguished PM (company expert, not managing)

**Salary:** Can reach $250K+ even without managing

**The Generalist / Manager Path:**
You move toward leadership and business responsibility.

Example: You move from owning one product to managing a team of PMs who own multiple products.

**Advantages:**
- Broader influence (you shape strategy for whole areas)
- Larger teams to build
- Path to executive team (CPO, CEO)
- Typically higher pay at scale

**Disadvantages:**
- Less hands-on product work
- More politics and politics
- People problems (harder than product problems)
- More pressure

**Typical progression:**
Senior PM → Group PM → Director → VP Product → CPO

**Salary:** Can reach $300K+ with broader influence

## Choosing Your Path

Ask yourself:

1. **Do I like people?** (or just tolerating them)
   - Like managing → Generalist path
   - Prefer depth/focus → Specialist path

2. **Do I want broader impact?**
   - Yes, shape company strategy → Generalist path
   - No, own one thing well → Specialist path

3. **Am I running from or toward something?**
   - Running from managing (you'd be bad at it) → Specialist path
   - Running toward it (you'd be good at it) → Generalist path

## Making the Transition

### If You Decide: Manager Path

1. **Have the conversation** with your manager
   - "I'm interested in transitioning to Group PM. What would that take?"
   
2. **Get opportunities to lead**
   - Lead hiring
   - Lead cross-functional initiatives
   - Mentor others

3. **Take a management role**
   - Ideally within your company (easier transition)
   - If not possible, move to a different company
   
4. **Learn on the job**
   - Get a mentor
   - Read management books
   - Invest in management training

### If You Decide: Specialist Path

1. **Talk to your manager**
   - "I want to go deep in [domain]. What's the path?"
   
2. **Become an expert**
   - Take courses
   - Lead initiatives in your domain
   - Present externally (conference talks, blog posts)
   
3. **Create the role**
   - "Principal PM for Monetization"
   - "Distinguished PM for Infrastructure"
   - Titles that reflect expertise, not just seniority

## The Long-Term View

**Year 1-3:** PM
- Shipping features
- Learning the discipline
- Building credibility

**Year 4-7:** Senior PM
- Strategic influence
- Mentoring
- Deciding on specialist vs. manager path

**Year 7-10+:** Specialist or Manager
- **Specialist:** Principal/Distinguished PM (deep expertise)
- **Manager:** Group PM / Director (team leader)

**Year 10+:** 
- **Specialist:** Still contributing as expert
- **Manager:** VP / CPO (company strategy)

Both paths lead to fulfilling, well-compensated careers. The difference is where you get impact: depth (specialist) or breadth (manager).

## Conclusion

There's no single "right" path. The right path is the one that aligns with how you want to work and where you want to have impact.

Reflect honestly on what excites you. Then pursue that path with intention.
