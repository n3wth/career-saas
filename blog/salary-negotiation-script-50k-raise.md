# The Salary Negotiation Script That Got Me a $50K Raise (Tested & Approved)

I'll give you the exact script I used to negotiate a $50K raise at Google in 2022. Then I'll show you why it works, and how to adapt it to your situation.

This isn't a template from a negotiation book. It's the actual conversation, word-for-word, that resulted in a 40% salary increase.

## The Setup

**Context:** I was a Senior Product Manager at Google. I'd been in the role for 18 months. I'd delivered 2 major projects (shipped features that drove 8% revenue increase). I knew my market value (from talking to recruiters, peers, and salary databases) was $280K-320K. I was making $230K.

**Timing:** Mid-Q4, after the annual review cycle. The company had cash. The timing was right.

**Preparation:** I spent 2 weeks building a document with:
- My accomplishments (quantified)
- Market data (Levels.fyi, Blind, Comparably)
- Peer salaries (anonymously gathered)
- My case for promotion

I didn't share the document yet. I just knew my numbers cold.

## The Conversation (Word-for-Word)

**Setting:** My manager's office, 30-minute meeting. I requested it a week in advance: "I'd like to discuss my compensation. I have some thoughts I'd like to share."

---

**Me:** "Thanks for taking the time. I've been thinking about my compensation and I wanted to have a direct conversation.

I've been in this role for 18 months. In that time, I've shipped [feature 1] and [feature 2], which we've measured at 8% revenue increase. My team velocity improved 40% through [specific initiative]. I also led the [cross-functional project] which brought on 3 enterprise customers.

I know my market value. Senior PMs with my experience, at companies like Google, are making $280K-320K in base salary. Levels.fyi shows $275K-310K for my level. 

I'm currently at $230K. I'd like to discuss bringing my comp to $280K, which is below the market rate for my level."

---

**Manager:** "I appreciate you doing your homework. Your impact has been great. But you know we can't just match market rates. We have equity considerations, and the budget is tight this quarter."

---

**Me:** "I understand the budget constraints. But let me reframe this: this isn't about matching market rates. This is about retaining someone who's generating $X in value to the company. 

I have offers on the table from [Company 1] and [Company 2] at $290K and $310K respectively. I'm not interested in leaving—I love the work and the team. But I need my compensation to reflect the market reality for my level and impact.

$280K gets me to market rate. I think that's fair for both of us."

---

**Manager:** "Let me be honest—I can't approve that on my own. I need to go to my manager and make the case. But I think it's reasonable. What's your timeline?"

---

**Me:** "I appreciate that. Here's my timeline: I'd like this resolved by [specific date, 2 weeks away]. I'm not trying to rush you, but I do want clarity before I make any final decisions about staying or going."

---

**Manager:** "Fair. Let me go talk to my manager. I'll get back to you by [date]."

**[One week passes]**

---

**Manager:** "Good news. My manager approved $270K base salary, effective [date]. It's not the full $280K, but it's a significant increase. The equity package is also getting bumped. Altogether, it's about a $50K increase in comp."

---

**Me:** "I appreciate you making the case. $270K is good, and I'm happy with the equity bump. I'm in."

---

## Why This Script Works

### 1. **It's grounded in data, not emotion**

❌ Bad: "I deserve more because I work hard."  
✅ Good: "Market rate for my level is $280K-320K. I'm at $230K."

Data is harder to argue with. Your manager can't say "No, market rate is actually $200K." The data is public.

### 2. **It shows you've done your homework**

The fact that I had:
- Specific accomplishments with numbers
- Market data from 3 sources
- Alternative offers (this matters)
- Clear timeline

...made me look professional, not desperate.

### 3. **It focuses on value, not need**

❌ Bad: "I need more money because rent is expensive."  
✅ Good: "I generated $X in value. Market rate for that value is $Y. I'm paid $Z."

Focus on the value you create, not your personal financial situation.

### 4. **It gives your manager an out**

Notice I said: "I understand the budget constraints." This lets your manager save face. You're not putting them in an adversarial position.

Then I reframed it: "This isn't about the budget. This is about retaining talent at market rate." Now they're not defending a budget. They're defending retention.

### 5. **It adds urgency without being threatening**

"I have other offers on the table" is the most powerful statement in salary negotiation. It's not a threat. It's just reality. Your manager now understands that if they don't act, you might leave.

But notice I framed it positively: "I'm not interested in leaving—I love the work and the team." This softens the threat. You're not saying "Pay me or I'm out." You're saying "I want to stay, but I need fair compensation."

### 6. **It's specific about timeline**

"I'd like this resolved by [date]" is better than "I want an answer soon." It gives both of you a clear deadline. Your manager can't just ignore it indefinitely.

## How to Adapt This for Your Situation

### If You're Early-Career

Your script might look different:

"I've been in this role for [time period]. My accomplishments: [2-3 specific things]. I've looked at market rates for my level—Levels.fyi shows [range]. I'm currently at [current salary]. I'd like to move to [target salary]."

You probably don't have "other offers." That's okay. Just use market data.

### If You're at a Startup

"We're more constrained than Google, so here's what I'm asking: 
- Can we increase base by [amount]?
- Can we increase equity by [amount]?
- If not both, then which?"

At startups, equity is often the lever. You might get 0.05% more equity instead of a larger base increase. That's fine if the company is good.

### If You're Negotiating Promotion + Raise

"I've been promoted to [level]. The market rate for [level] is [range]. I'd like my new comp to be [target]."

Companies sometimes try to promote you but "compress" your salary increase. Don't let that happen. You got promoted to a new market rate. Demand it.

### If You Don't Have Market Data

Use these sources:
- **Levels.fyi** (tech salaries by level and company)
- **Comparably** (salaries by role and company)
- **Blind** (anonymous employee reports)
- **Payscale** (general salary ranges)
- **Peers** (ask your network confidentially)

Combine 3+ sources and you have defensible data.

## Common Objections & How to Handle Them

### "The budget is tight this year"

Response: "I understand. But this is about market rate for my role. If you wait until next year, my ask will be even higher, and I might be somewhere else by then."

### "You're a junior and we pay for growth"

Response: "I'm happy to grow here. But the market rate for someone with my experience is [range]. If I went to [competitor], I'd get $X. Help me understand what I need to do differently here."

### "We can't bump you that high"

Response: "What range is possible? Let's work with that and see if we can get close to market rate."

### "You're asking for too much"

Response: "These numbers come from Levels.fyi, which has [number] datapoints from people in this exact role at this exact company. Am I reading the market wrong?"

## The Numbers

Let's talk about actual impact:

- **Getting 5% raise:** You got lucky. You negotiated slightly above inflation.
- **Getting 10-20% raise:** You negotiated well. You got above-market increase.
- **Getting 30%+ raise:** You negotiated really well. You're now closer to market rate.

This script led to a 17.4% raise ($50K on $287K total comp). That's not unusual if:
1. You've been underpaid
2. You have good data
3. You have alternatives
4. You time it right

## When This Script Doesn't Work

Be honest with yourself:

- **You're in a declining company.** They're cutting costs, not giving raises.
- **You're underperfoming.** Your accomplishments are weak compared to peers.
- **You have no alternatives.** You're stuck and your manager knows it.
- **You're in a very junior role.** Market rates are low. You can't bump 30%.
- **Your company is in crisis.** They're in survival mode, not compensation mode.

If any of these are true, this script won't work. But here's what will:

"I understand we're in a constrained situation. What I can do now to set myself up for a raise when things improve?"

Plant the seed. Show you're thinking long-term. When things get better, you'll be first in line.

## The Outcome

I got a $50K raise. But more importantly, I got clarity:
- My compensation was now at market rate
- My manager understood my value
- I had a timeline for the next review
- I wasn't leaving

Two years later, I leveraged that market rate into an even bigger role at another company. The negotiation skills paid dividends.

**The core principle:** Know your market value. Have the data. Have alternatives. Have a clear ask. State it clearly.

Do that, and you'll get a raise.

Most people don't do the prep work. That's why 90% of salary negotiation results are mediocre. You can be in the top 10%.
