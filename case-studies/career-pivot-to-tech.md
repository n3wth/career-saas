# Case Study: Career Pivot to Tech - From Teacher to Software Engineer

**Client:** Sarah (Teacher → Software Engineer) | **Timeline:** 12 months | **Bootcamp:** General Assembly | **Outcome:** $130K engineering offer at Series B startup

## The Challenge

Sarah was a high school teacher for 8 years. She loved the impact of teaching, but hated the pay ($55K/year). She had summers off. She had burned out twice.

She kept thinking: "What if I learned to code?"

She was terrified:
- "Am I too old?" (33 years old)
- "Can I really learn tech?" (non-technical background)
- "Will anyone hire me?" (no experience)
- "What if I waste time and money?"

But she decided to try.

---

## The Decision

Sarah spent 6 months researching bootcamps.

She looked at:
- Time commitment (full-time vs. part-time)
- Cost ($15-20K)
- Job guarantee
- Alumni outcomes

She chose General Assembly: 12-week full-time bootcamp, $16K, job-focused.

**Decision:** Quit teaching, do bootcamp, get engineering job.

---

## Phase 1: Bootcamp (3 months)

Sarah quit her job and started bootcamp. No income. Living off savings.

**Month 1:** Fundamentals
- Learning JavaScript
- HTML/CSS basics
- Debugging skills

"I feel like an idiot. Everyone else knows so much more."

(This is normal. She pushed through.)

**Month 2:** Building Things
- Built first project (portfolio site)
- Built second project (weather app)
- Started collaborating with other bootcamp students

"I shipped something people used. That's a feeling I never had as a teacher."

**Month 3:** Capstone Project + Job Search
- Built a meaningful project (financial management app)
- Presented to investors/employers
- Job search began

---

## Phase 2: Job Search (2-3 months)

Sarah had finished bootcamp. She had a portfolio. She had 3 projects.

She had no professional experience.

### What Worked

**1. Bootcamp job placement support:** General Assembly connected her with employers specifically hiring bootcamp grads. Massive advantage.

**2. Portfolio projects:** Sarah's capstone project was good. She could explain it, show code, talk about technical decisions.

**3. Teaching background was an advantage, not a disadvantage:**
- "I can explain complex concepts clearly"
- "I'm good at learning (learned JavaScript in 3 months)"
- "I'm disciplined and follow through"

These are actual strengths in a junior engineer.

**4. Targeting right companies:** Sarah focused on:
- Series A-C startups (less picky about traditional experience)
- Mission-driven companies (she cared about impact)
- Teams that had bootcamp grads before
- Avoided: FAANG (too competitive), mature companies (prefer traditional background)

### The Rejection Ringer

Sarah applied to 30 companies. Got rejected from 27. Interview loop with 3.

**Interview loop 1:** Stripe
- Pair programming test was hard
- She failed
- Learned a lot, but didn't get offer

**Interview loop 2:** Midsize AI startup
- Technical screen: Passed
- System design: They didn't ask (junior role)
- Culture fit: Great
- Offer: $110K

"I don't know if I should take it. This seems low. But it's double my teacher salary."

She negotiated: "I was expecting $120K given the market. Can we do that?"

Counter: "We can do $115K and extra stock."

She accepted.

### Interview loop 3: Series B Startup (her current role)
- Technical screen: Strong pass
- Pair programming: Worked well with the team
- Architecture discussion: Learned about their codebase
- Culture fit: Clicked with team
- Offer: $130K + $80K stock

She chose this offer. Better company, better team, better growth potential.

## Phase 3: First Year as Engineer

Sarah started her first engineering job.

**First month:**
- Set up dev environment (2 days)
- First PR (small bug fix): Took 8 hours
- First code review: Brutal. She had to rewrite the code.
- Imposter syndrome: "I don't belong here"

**Month 2-3:**
- Getting faster (first PR now takes 4 hours)
- Understanding codebase (less Googling)
- Meeting the team (they're actually nice)
- Building confidence (her code is being used)

**Month 4-6:**
- Owned a full feature (end-to-end)
- Code reviews are easier (she's learning their style)
- Teaching others: "Sarah's great at explaining things"
- Actually enjoying this

**Month 7-12:**
- Promoted to "mid-level engineer" (fast tracking)
- Salary bumped to $140K
- Mentoring intern
- Leading small technical projects

## The Transition Learnings

### Learning 1: Age Doesn't Matter

Sarah was 33. Plenty of other bootcamp students were 35-45.

Companies care about:
- Can you code? (yes)
- Can you learn? (yes)
- Will you stick around? (yes)
- Are you a good teammate? (yes)

Age is irrelevant.

### Learning 2: Teaching Prepared Her

Her biggest advantages:
- **Explaining concepts clearly:** Engineers spent less time helping her because she could understand explanations
- **Learning discipline:** She learned JavaScript faster than many because she had learned how to learn
- **Growth mindset:** Teachers are used to not knowing things; they get over imposter syndrome fast

### Learning 3: Bootcamp Works

This wasn't luck. Bootcamp works if you:
- Pick a good bootcamp (not all are equal)
- Do the work (don't coast)
- Build a good portfolio (your projects are your resume)
- Target the right companies (not FAANG on day 1)
- Negotiate (you have more power than you think)

## Client Testimonial

**Sarah (Now mid-level engineer, 18 months post-bootcamp):**

"I was terrified. At 33, quitting my job to learn code felt crazy. But I did the math: Stay as teacher, earn $55K forever. Learn to code, earn $130K+ in year 1.

The risk was worth it.

First 3 months of bootcamp were the hardest. I wanted to quit. But I pushed through. By month 3, I was shipping code. By month 6, I had a job offer.

18 months in, I'm making more than I've ever made. Working with incredible people. Solving hard problems. And I still have that teaching background—I'm known as "the engineer who can explain things clearly."

Best decision I've made."

## How to Replicate This Path

### If You're Considering a Bootcamp

1. **Research bootcamps:** Not all are equal. Look at alumni outcomes, job placement rates, reviews.
2. **Pick one with job guarantees:** You want placement support.
3. **Build a strong portfolio:** Your projects are your resume.
4. **Target the right companies:** Start-ups, mission-driven companies, companies that hire bootcamp grads.
5. **Negotiate:** You have leverage. Don't take the first offer.

### Companies Hiring Bootcamp Grads

These candidates are valuable:
- They're hungry (they made a big bet)
- They're disciplined (bootcamp is hard)
- They're good learners (they went from zero to hero in 3 months)
- They're not jaded (no bad habits to unlearn)

---

## The Hard Truth

Not every bootcamp student becomes an engineer. Some:
- Can't handle the pace (bootcamp is intensive)
- Can't handle the learning curve (math is involved)
- Can't find a job (market is competitive)
- Find work unsuitable (imposter syndrome persists)

Sarah succeeded because:
1. She was determined
2. She picked a good bootcamp
3. She built a strong portfolio
4. She targeted the right opportunities
5. She negotiated

## Conclusion

Career pivots to tech work. They work especially well if:
1. You pick a good bootcamp
2. You do the work
3. You build a portfolio
4. You target the right companies
5. You're willing to start junior

Sarah went from $55K teacher to $140K engineer in 18 months.
