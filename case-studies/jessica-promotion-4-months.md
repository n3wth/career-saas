# Jessica Anderson: Mid-Level to Senior Engineer in 4 Months

**Client:** Jessica Anderson, Senior Engineer at TechCorp (Growth Stage)  
**Timeline:** 4 months  
**Result:** Promoted from Mid-Level (L3) to Senior (L4), $35K salary increase, leading cross-team initiatives

---

## The Problem: Invisible Impact

Jessica had been a mid-level engineer for 2.5 years. She was good at her job. Her manager liked her. But promotion conversations went nowhere.

> "My manager kept saying 'you're doing great, just keep it up.' But I wasn't getting promoted. I didn't know what was missing."

### The Situation

**Jessica's work (reality):**
- Shipped 15+ features in the past year
- Mentored 2 junior engineers
- Fixed critical production bugs
- Reviewed 100+ PRs

**Jessica's visibility (perception):**
- Manager knew she was "solid"
- Skip-level (director) didn't know her name
- Promo committee had no data on her impact
- Peers thought she "just wrote code"

**The disconnect:** Great work. Zero visibility.

## The Solution: Strategic Career Positioning

### Month 1: Document Your Wins

We built Jessica's **impact portfolio**:

## Key Lessons Learned

### 1. Impact Without Visibility = No Promotion
Great work doesn't promote you. Great work *that people know about* promotes you.

### 2. Document Everything
If you can't prove your impact with data, it didn't happen (in the eyes of promo committees).

### 3. Manage Up
Your manager is busy. Make their job easy: send weekly updates, share wins, build your own case.

### 4. Visibility ≠ Bragging
Sharing wins professionally is leadership. Stay humble, focus on impact, credit your team.

### 5. Promotions Are a Game
Learn the rules. Play the game. Win.
