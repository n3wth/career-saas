## You've Hit a Wall

You've been in the same role for 2-3 years. You're competent. You ship work. But:

- Your salary hasn't moved in 18 months
- Promotions aren't happening
- Better opportunities aren't coming to you
- You feel stuck

This is the career plateau. Most people experience it. Most never escape it.

The ones who do make specific moves. Not random ones. Strategic ones.

I'm going to walk you through the exact framework I use to help people break through, get promoted, or land 2x better opportunities.

## Part 1: Why You're Stuck (The Real Reason)

Most people think the problem is:
- "I'm not good enough" (false)
- "I need better luck" (false)
- "My company doesn't value me" (maybe, but not the main issue)

The real reason you're stuck: **You're invisible.**

Your work is good. But nobody high enough to make career decisions knows about you. Your manager knows. Maybe your team knows. But the VP? The company leadership? They have no idea.

Simultaneously, you've probably **over-indexed on execution** and under-indexed on visibility.

You're the person who:
- Ships features on time
- Fixes problems nobody asked you to fix
- Stays late to unblock teammates
- Takes on extra work nobody wants

That's great. But it's a local optimization, not a career optimization.

## Part 2: The Three Pillars of Career Growth

### Pillar 1: Exceptional Execution

You need to be genuinely excellent at your current role. This is table stakes.

But here's what most people get wrong: They think exceptional execution = promotion.

It doesn't. Exceptional execution = job security. That's valuable, but it's not career growth.

**What matters:**
- Shipping on time consistently ✅
- Code quality is high ✅
- You unblock others ✅

**What doesn't matter as much:**
- Working 60-hour weeks (unsustainable, looks desperate)
- Taking on 5 projects at once (jack of all trades)
- Saying yes to every request (sets bad precedent)

Excellence is a prerequisite, not a destination.

### Pillar 2: Strategic Visibility

You need people who make career decisions to know your name and your impact.

**How:**

1. **Document your impact in a way that reaches leadership**

Not this: "I shipped the new features"

This: "I shipped 6 features in Q4. Two drove $500K in new revenue (based on sales reporting). One reduced customer churn by 3%. One improved system reliability by 25%. Here's the impact on business metrics."

Suddenly you're not just a shipping machine. You're a business contributor.

2. **Present your work to leadership**

Most engineers are afraid of public speaking. Do it anyway.

Next all-hands meeting, volunteer to demo your work. 5 minutes. 1 slide. "Here's what we shipped and why it matters."

Do this once per quarter. In 2 years, you've presented 8 times. You're no longer a name. You're a face.

3. **Write about your work**

Not a blog post (unless you want to). A company-wide email or Slack message:

"Q4 Retrospective: What I Learned About Performance Optimization"

Share:
- What you learned
- Why it matters
- What changed as a result

Send to your team, your manager's manager, and relevant stakeholders.

This takes 20 minutes. It reaches 50+ people.

4. **Seek high-visibility projects**

Not the most comfortable project. The most visible one.

Projects that:
- Touch multiple teams
- Have executive sponsor
- Impact revenue or retention
- Are known to struggle

When you solve them, people notice.

### Pillar 3: Skill Differentiation

You need at least one thing you're exceptionally good at that's valuable to the business.

**Not this:**
- "I'm good at coding" (everyone is)
- "I'm a good problem solver" (everyone is)
- "I'm reliable" (everyone should be)

**This:**
- "I'm the person who can take a 6-month project that's stalled and ship it in 8 weeks"
- "I'm the expert in our infrastructure and can optimize for 10x scale"
- "I understand customer needs better than anyone else—I talk to customers twice per week"

That differentiation is your leverage.

**How to build it:**

1. **Pick something valuable** (links to business goals)
2. **Become the expert** (invest 20% of your time)
3. **Make it known** (tell people about it)
4. **Add value with it** (solve problems using this skill)

In 12 months, you're the person everyone calls for X. That's your leverage.

## Part 3: The 90-Day Breakthrough Plan

### Month 1: Build the Foundation

**Week 1-2: Audit your career**

Answer these honestly:
- What's my current impact (in revenue or business terms)?
- Who knows my name in leadership?
- What am I exceptional at?
- What's the 1 skill that would differentiate me?
- What's my realistic promotion timeline in my current role?

**Week 3: Set targets**

Pick:
- **One executive sponsor** (someone 2-3 levels above you)
- **One high-visibility project**
- **One skill to develop**
- **One metric** (promotion, title change, X% raise, or move to different role)

**Week 4: Start building visibility**

- Present at a team standup
- Write a brief recap of your work
- Set up 1:1 with your executive sponsor (find a business reason)

### Month 2: Execute & Demonstrate

**Week 5-6: Take the high-visibility project**

Commit to something that:
- You can complete in 6-8 weeks
- Has clear business impact
- Requires cross-team coordination
- Puts you in front of leadership

**Week 7: Document your approach**

Write a brief doc:
- "Here's the problem"
- "Here's my approach"
- "Here's what success looks like"
- "Here's how I'll keep everyone informed"

Share with manager and executive sponsor.

**Week 8: Build momentum**

- Present a status update to leadership
- Share learnings from the project
- Ask for feedback

### Month 3: Seal the Deal

**Week 9-10: Complete the project**

Ship it. On time. High quality.

**Week 11: Amplify the impact**

- Present final results to leadership
- Quantify the impact
- Share learnings across teams

**Week 12: Have the conversation**

Go to your manager with:
- "Here's what I accomplished in 90 days"
- "Here's the impact on the business"
- "Here's what I want next" (promotion, new role, raise, etc.)

With 3 months of demonstrated impact and visibility, you have leverage.

## Part 4: Real Example (From an Engineer I Worked With)

**Starting point:** Mid-level engineer, 3 years at same level, $150K salary, feeling stuck

**Month 1:**
- Audited career: "I'm good at shipping, but I'm invisible above my team"
- Set target: Senior engineer promotion + $170K salary
- Started documenting impact: "This feature will drive $200K ARR"
- Picked executive sponsor: VP of Engineering

**Month 2:**
- Took on infrastructure migration project (high-visibility, high-impact)
- Wrote design doc explaining approach
- Presented to leadership weekly
- Built relationships with other teams

**Month 3:**
- Shipped migration on time
- Documented learnings (5% reduction in infrastructure costs = $100K annual savings)
- Presented final results to VP and CEO
- Had promotion conversation

**Result:**
- Promoted to senior engineer
- Salary bumped to $175K (asked for $170K, got more because impact was clear)
- Became known internally as "the infrastructure person"
- New opportunities started coming

**Timeline:** 90 days from stuck to promoted.

## Part 5: Common Mistakes (Don't Do These)

### Mistake 1: Waiting for Opportunities

"I'll wait until someone taps me for a big project"

Don't. Volunteer. Volunteer for the hard, visible project that nobody wants. That's your shortcut.

### Mistake 2: Assuming Your Manager Will Advocate

Your manager should, but they might not have the right forum. Advocate for yourself.

This isn't arrogant. It's professional.

### Mistake 3: Chasing Titles Without Impact

"I want to be a senior engineer because I've been here 3 years"

Companies don't care how long you've been there. They care about impact. Build impact first, title follows.

### Mistake 4: Over-Communicating About Problems

"Here's every problem I'm facing"

This doesn't work. It makes you look like you can't handle complexity.

Instead: "Here's the problem, here's my approach to solve it, here's what I need from leadership."

### Mistake 5: Not Having a Clear 'Next'

"I want more responsibility" (vague)

vs.

"I want to lead the infrastructure project and become the senior engineer owner of that domain" (specific)

Be specific. People can't help you if your goal is unclear.

## Part 6: What This Looks Like by Role

### If you're an engineer:
- Pillar 1: Shipping on time, high-quality code
- Pillar 2: Present technical learnings, document impact
- Pillar 3: Become expert in (infra, performance, security, etc.)

### If you're a designer:
- Pillar 1: Beautiful work that solves problems
- Pillar 2: Present design thinking, impact on user metrics
- Pillar 3: Become expert in (design systems, user research, accessibility, etc.)

### If you're a product manager:
- Pillar 1: Ship roadmap on time, hit metrics
- Pillar 2: Present strategy to leadership, customer insights
- Pillar 3: Become expert in (pricing, go-to-market, growth, etc.)

The framework is the same. The specifics change by role.

## Part 7: Handling Rejection

Sometimes you do all this and get told "no, not yet"

This happened to me. It's not the end.

**When they say no:**
1. Ask why specifically
2. Ask what would change their mind
3. Ask when you can revisit
4. Keep building your case

"Not yet" beats "not ever"

Assume it's a 6-month delay and keep going.

## The Takeaway

Your career plateau isn't permanent. It's a signal that you need to:

1. **Execute exceptionally** (table stakes)
2. **Make your impact visible** (critical)
3. **Differentiate yourself** (your leverage)

Do these three things for 90 days with intensity and purpose.

Most people don't. Most people coast.

If you do, you'll break through.
