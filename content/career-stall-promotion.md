# The Career Stall: Why You're Not Getting Promoted (And What Actually Works)

**Reading time:** 7 minutes | **For:** Mid-career professionals, individual contributors, team leads

You've been in your role for 2+ years. You're good at what you do. Your manager likes you. But nobody's talking about promotion.

This is the career stall—and it's incredibly common. You're not in crisis, but you're stuck.

Here's the reality: being good at your current role doesn't predict promotion. In fact, if you're really good, your manager has a perverse incentive to keep you there. You're valuable to the team *now*. Promoting you means losing that value.

The path to promotion isn't about doing your current job better. It's about making yourself dispensable and proving you're ready for the next level.

## Why Promotions Stall

Let's start with how promotions actually work.

**Promotion is not:** Your manager deciding you're ready  
**Promotion is:** Leadership collectively deciding you're solving problems above your current level

The distinction matters. Because it means your manager alone can't promote you (in most organizations). And it means being great at your current job is actually a barrier to promotion.

### The Perception Problem

Your manager thinks:
- "She's doing excellent work in her current role"
- "If I promote her, I lose her as an IC"
- "She hasn't shown she can do the next level yet"
- Translation: "I want to keep her where she is"

Her peers think:
- "I don't know much about her work"
- "She seems competent, but is she ready for my level?"
- "I haven't seen her handle high-stakes situations"
- Translation: "Not enough evidence"

Her skip-level thinks:
- "Never heard of her"
- Translation: "Nonexistent"

Result: No promotion, despite being good.

### The Visibility Problem

Promotions happen in rooms where you're not present. Your work only matters if the people in those rooms know about it.

This isn't about being loud or self-promotional. It's about making sure the right people know:
1. What problems you're solving
2. Why those problems matter
3. How you're solving them differently than someone at your current level would

Most people assume this information flows automatically. It doesn't.

### The Scope Problem

You're great at your current scope. But scope is fixed. You've hit the ceiling of what that role can deliver.

To get promoted, you need to prove you can handle *bigger* scope. This means:
- Taking on problems that don't fit neatly in your job description
- Solving problems that affect other teams, not just yours
- Handling ambiguity and cross-functional complexity

But here's the catch: these opportunities don't arrive in your lap. You have to create them.

## The Framework: Three Moves to Promotion

### Move 1: Get Visible (Months 1-2)

This is about making sure people know what you do and why it matters.

**Action 1: Map the decision-makers**

Who decides on promotion for your level and the next level? Usually:
- Your direct manager
- Your manager's manager (skip-level)
- Peer managers at your level
- HR/People operations

Write down 5-7 specific names.

**Action 2: Create a "story" for your work**

Most people talk about work like this: "I led the infrastructure redesign project and we improved latency by 40%."

Better: "We were losing 15% of users at the payment screen because latency was 4 seconds. The company was leaving $2M on the table annually. I led a cross-functional effort to rebuild our infrastructure, and latency dropped to 1.2 seconds. Within 30 days, we recovered 14% of those users, generating $1.8M in incremental annual revenue."

Notice the difference? The first is a metric. The second is a *business outcome*.

**Action 3: Get on a visible project or initiative**

Look for projects that:
- Touch multiple teams (visibility)
- Have executive sponsorship (air cover)
- Solve a problem the leadership team cares about
- Take 2-4 months (long enough to show impact)

Volunteer. Make it clear you want to lead it (or co-lead it).

### Move 2: Prove Next-Level Thinking (Months 3-6)

This is about showing you solve problems like someone at the next level would, not like someone at your current level does.

**The difference:**
- **Current level thinking:** "How do I solve this problem better?"
- **Next level thinking:** "How do I solve this problem in a way that enables others to solve similar problems?"

**Concrete example:**

Current level: "Our database queries are slow. Let me optimize them. [Done]"

Next level: "Our database queries are slow. What's the pattern? Let me build a framework that helps engineers across teams avoid this class of problem in the future. [Also, I documented it and taught 3 other teams how to use it]"

**How to practice next-level thinking:**

1. Take a problem you've solved
2. Ask: "What's the pattern here?"
3. Ask: "How could I generalize this so 5 other people benefit?"
4. Implement the generalization

Examples:
- Optimization → Framework or principle
- Feature → System that enables features
- Process improvement → Documented practice that becomes standard
- One customer success → Program that scales to 10 customers

**Move 2 actions:**
- [ ] Find 3 areas where you're currently solving the same problem repeatedly
- [ ] For each area, build a framework or system that lets others solve it
- [ ] Document and share
- [ ] Make sure your skip-level hears about it

### Move 3: Expand Your Scope (Months 6-12)

This is about taking on problems that are explicitly bigger than your current role.

**What expanded scope looks like:**
- You're solving problems for 2+ teams, not just yours
- You're involved in decisions that affect $1M+ or 100K+ users
- You're mentoring/unblocking peers
- You're representing your organization externally (customer meetings, conference, etc.)

**How to find expanded-scope opportunities:**

Listen for problems that are:
- "Nobody owns this yet"
- "This affects multiple teams"
- "The CEO mentioned this" or "The board is asking about this"
- "We need someone to figure this out"

Raise your hand. Say: "I'd like to own this."

**Real example:**
- Your manager: "We need to improve our API documentation, but it's not anyone's job specifically."
- You: "I'd like to own this. Here's my 30-day plan to audit it, here's my 60-day plan to rebuild it, here's how I'd structure it so it stays maintained."
- You own it, run it, make it happen.
- Six months later, API adoption is up 40%, onboarding time is down, and you've touched every team in the company.

That's expanded scope.

## The Timeline

**Months 1-2:** Get visible, tell stories, find a high-visibility project

**Months 3-6:** Ship the project, prove next-level thinking, generalize your learnings

**Months 6-12:** Take on expanded-scope work, build relationships with decision-makers

**Month 12:** Promotion conversation happens naturally, because you've de-risked it

## Red Flags You're Still in the Stall

❌ **Your manager is the only person who knows your work.** (You need visibility beyond your manager)

❌ **You're solving the same problems over and over.** (You should be building frameworks, not repeating work)

❌ **You've never had a "stretch project."** (You need scope expansion to be promotion-eligible)

❌ **You've never talked to your skip-level about your work.** (That gap is killing you)

❌ **Your work only affects your team.** (Promotion typically requires cross-team impact)

## Template: Your Promotion Plan

```markdown

### Current problems I solve repeatedly:
1. [Problem type] - [frequency]
2. [Problem type] - [frequency]

### Frameworks/systems I'll build:
1. [Framework name] - [what it enables]
2. [Framework name] - [what it enables]

### Sharing plan:
- [ ] Document by [date]
- [ ] Train [# of teams]
- [ ] Make sure skip-level knows

## Move 3: Expand Scope

### Expanded-scope opportunities I'm targeting:
1. [Opportunity] - [scope] - [timeline]
2. [Opportunity] - [scope] - [timeline]

### How I'll build relationships:
- [ ] Coffee with [peer manager] - goal: understand their problems
- [ ] Volunteer for [cross-functional initiative]
```

## Why This Works

This framework works because it changes the narrative from "I want to be promoted" to "I'm already solving problems at the next level."

By the time the promotion conversation happens, it's not a debate. It's an acknowledgment of where you already are.

Promotion isn't about ambition. It's about capability + visibility + scope.

## The Reality Check

This takes work. It takes initiative. It takes months, not weeks.

But here's what you get:
- **In 3 months:** Clarity on what promotion actually requires (most people don't have this)
- **In 6 months:** Clear advancement (you're now known for high-impact work)
- **In 12 months:** Promotion, or at minimum, a clear path and a strong relationship with decision-makers

And if promotion doesn't happen at your current company? You've built a portfolio of high-impact work that makes you incredibly hireable elsewhere at a higher level.
