## The Myth

Most people think you need to threaten to leave to get a raise.

"I have an offer from Company X for $180K, so give me $175K or I'm gone"

Sometimes this works. Often it backfires. And it definitely creates tension.

There's a better way. One that gets you the raise, keeps your relationships intact, and positions you for your next promotion.

I've used this framework to negotiate 20+ raises. Smallest: 15%. Largest: 45%. Average: 27%.

Here's exactly how it works.

## Part 1: Why Companies Reject Raises (And What to Do About It)

### Reason 1: You're in a Band

Most companies have salary bands per level:

```
Senior Engineer: $150K - $180K
```

If you're at $165K, the company thinks "you're in the normal range."

**Solution:** Move to a higher band. Go from Senior Engineer to Staff Engineer. Now the band is $180K - $230K.

Or, within your current band, argue that you're at the top end.

### Reason 2: The Company Has Budget Constraints

"We don't have budget for raises right now"

This is often true. But it's not the whole story.

**Solution:** Make the business case for YOUR raise specifically. "This costs the company $X but saves us $Y through improved productivity / retention / revenue impact."

If your raise costs $15K but prevents turnover that would cost $150K in hiring/training, that's a business case for the raise.

### Reason 3: No Documented Impact

Your manager doesn't have ammunition to fight for you.

**Solution:** Document your impact so your manager can advocate. "Sarah drove $200K in new revenue" is way more compelling than "Sarah is a solid engineer."

### Reason 4: You Haven't Asked in a While

Companies assume if you're not asking, you're happy.

**Solution:** Ask every 12-18 months. Make it routine, not a big deal.

## Part 2: The Leverage Framework

Before you ask for a raise, build leverage. Leverage is:

**Strong if:**
- You've delivered exceptional impact (quantified)
- You have options (other companies interested)
- You're in a critical role
- You've been at current level for 1.5+ years
- Market rates have increased

**Weak if:**
- You just joined 3 months ago
- You're average performer
- Anyone can do your job
- You have no other options
- You just got a raise

Be honest about where you are.

## Part 3: The 3-Conversation Framework

### Conversation 1: The Planning Conversation (Happens 4-6 weeks before)

Go to your manager:

"I'd like to have a conversation about my compensation in 4-6 weeks. I want to come prepared with data about my impact and market rates. What does that look like on your end? And is there anything I should do now to strengthen my case?"

**Why this works:**
- You're giving them notice (they can plan)
- You're showing maturity (not ambushing)
- You're asking for their partnership (not demanding)
- You're doing the homework (not asking them to do it)

Most managers will appreciate this.

### Conversation 2: The Prep Conversation (2 weeks before)

Go to your manager again:

"I've done some research on market rates for my role in our city. I've also documented my impact over the last 18 months. I'd like to share both with you before I have the official conversation with leadership."

Share a document:

```
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION PREP

## My Role
- Senior Engineer, 3 years at company
- Team Lead for 5-person team
- Lead architect for $50M product

## Impact (Last 18 months)
- Shipped 3 major features (drove $200K ARR)
- Improved system reliability from 99.9% to 99.99%
- Mentored 4 junior engineers (2 got promoted)
- Reduced infrastructure costs by 20% ($100K annual)
- Led migration from monolith to microservices

## Market Rates
- Glassdoor: $165K - $210K for my level/city
- LinkedIn: $170K - $215K
- My network: $160K - $200K (for similar companies)
- Current salary: $155K

## Proposed New Salary: $190K
- 22.6% increase
- Brings me to median for my role
- Within band for this level

## Rationale
- Impact: $400K+ in business value delivered
- Retention: 3 companies approached me in last 6 months
- Market: My salary is below 25th percentile for my role
- Role: Expanded responsibilities since last raise
```

**Why:**
- You're giving your manager ammunition
- You're showing you've done homework
- You're asking for feedback, not demanding
- You're being specific

Your manager can now advocate for you with a specific document. They'll either:

A) Say "yes, let's go with $190K" (they're your champion)

B) Say "that's too high, but I'll fight for $175K" (now you know the ceiling)

C) Give you feedback: "You're right on the analysis, but the market data is off. Let me help you refine"

Either way, you're now in conversation mode, not demand mode.

### Conversation 3: The Official Conversation (With manager + leadership if needed)

If your manager supports you, they'll often handle this internally and come back to you with an offer.

If they need you to present, here's the format:

**Slide 1: Who You Are**
- Role: Senior Engineer
- Tenure: 3 years
- Level: Senior Engineer (same level for 18 months)

**Slide 2: What You've Delivered**
- $200K in new revenue
- 99.99% uptime (vs 99.9%)
- 4 engineers mentored, 2 promoted
- $100K infrastructure savings

**Slide 3: Market Data**
- Glassdoor median: $190K
- LinkedIn median: $195K
- Internal equity: I'm 15% below peer level engineers
- Current: $155K

**Slide 4: Your Ask**
- New salary: $190K
- Effective: Makes my comp market-competitive
- Timing: 12 months without adjustment
- This is reasonable and expected

That's it. 4 slides. 5 minutes.

Then shut up and listen.

## Part 4: Handling Different Responses

### Response 1: "Yes, We'll Match That"

Take it. Thank them. You're done.

### Response 2: "We Can Do $175K"

This is a negotiation. You have options:

**Option A: Counter**
"I appreciate that. Based on the market data and my impact, I'm hoping for $190K. Would $185K work?"

**Option B: Accept with contingencies**
"I appreciate the offer. I'm looking for market-competitive compensation. Can we revisit in 6 months and target $185K?"

**Option C: Accept but get clarity**
"I appreciate that. What would I need to deliver to justify $190K in the future?"

### Response 3: "We Don't Have Budget Right Now"

Ask for specifics:
"I understand. When would be a good time to revisit this? Q2? End of year?"

And then:
"In the meantime, is there anything I can do to strengthen my case?"

This buys you time and shows flexibility.

### Response 4: "That's Too High"

Ask why:
"I want to understand your thinking. Is it the market data? The impact assessment? The budget? Help me understand so I can adjust my proposal."

Listen. They might be right. Or you might need to help them see your impact differently.

## Part 5: Real Example

**Starting point:** Sarah, Senior Engineer at Series B company, $155K, 3 years tenure

**Step 1: Planning conversation (Week 1)**
Sarah to her manager: "I'd like to discuss compensation in a month. I'll do market research and impact analysis. Want to partner on this?"
Manager: "Great. Yeah let's do it."

**Step 2: Prep conversation (Week 3)**
Sarah shares document showing:
- $300K business impact
- Market rate: $185K-$200K
- Ask: $190K

Manager reads it and says: "I like this. Let me talk to my boss. I think we can do $180K."

**Step 3: Final conversation (Week 4)**
Manager comes back: "Good news. We can do $180K. You did great work on the analysis. We're excited to invest in keeping you."

Sarah got $25K raise (16% increase) without having to:
- Threaten to leave
- Create tension
- Negotiate aggressively
- Play games

**Why this worked:**
- She prepared thoroughly
- She positioned it as a partnership with her manager
- She focused on impact, not entitlement
- She was reasonable in her ask (not 50% raise)
- She gave her manager time to prepare

## Part 6: What If You Get Rejected?

"No, we can't do this"

Now you have choices:

**Choice 1: Accept and Move On**
"Okay, I understand. Can we revisit in 12 months?"

**Choice 2: Look Elsewhere**
"I appreciate the feedback. I'm going to explore other opportunities."

And then actually look. Don't bluff.

**Choice 3: Negotiate Differently**
"If the salary number is firm, is there flexibility on bonuses? Remote work? Extra PTO? Professional development budget?"

Companies sometimes have constraints on salary but flexibility elsewhere.

## Part 7: The Annual Cycle

Don't make this a one-time thing. Make it your annual process:

**January:** Reflect on last year's impact
**February:** Research market rates
**March:** Have planning conversation
**April:** Prepare analysis
**May:** Have official conversation

Every year. Boring. Predictable. Professional.

Companies expect this. It's normal. It's not greedy.

## Key Principles

1. **Prepare thoroughly** - Do the work. It shows respect.
2. **Focus on impact** - Not "I deserve it" but "I delivered X value"
3. **Partner with your manager** - Not against them
4. **Be specific** - Market rates, impact numbers, your ask
5. **Be reasonable** - 15-25% increase is reasonable. 50% is not.
6. **Give time** - Don't ambush
7. **Have a plan B** - Be willing to look elsewhere if they say no

## Conclusion

You don't need to threaten to leave to get a raise. You need to:

- Document your impact
- Research market rates
- Partner with your manager
- Make a clear, reasonable case

Do this once per year. In 5 years, a 25% annual increase compounds to 170% total increase.

That's career growth.
