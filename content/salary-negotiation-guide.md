# The Salary Negotiation Script That Increased Our Engineer's Offer by $45K

**Reading time:** 8 minutes | **For:** Job seekers, career changers, anyone negotiating compensation

Your offer came in: $165K base, $40K bonus, equity.

You know you're worth more. But you also know that negotiating wrong can kill the offer.

So you send a polite email asking for "market rate" and hope they say yes.

They say no. Offer stands. You're stuck deciding: take it or walk.

This is where most people lose $30-50K—not because they don't deserve more, but because they don't know how to ask.

There's a framework for this. We've used it with 50+ people, and it works.

## Why Most Salary Negotiations Fail

**Problem 1: You ask for a number without anchoring.**
- You: "Can I get $180K?"
- Them: "That's above our range. Final offer is $165K."
- You lose.

They had a number. You picked a number out of thin air. The conversation is over.

**Problem 2: You frame it as "I want more."**
- Them: "She's asking for more money. We already offered market rate. Next candidate."
- The company sees you as greedy, not as someone who understands your value.

**Problem 3: You negotiate in writing.**
- Email is permanent. It's easy to say no.
- A phone call is harder to refuse. You can build rapport, answer objections in real-time, and create a sense of partnership.

**Problem 4: You negotiate salary in isolation.**
- You ask for $180K and they say no.
- But you could have gotten $170K + better title + extra equity + signing bonus.
- The offer has lots of levers. Most people only pull one.

## The Three-Step Framework

### Step 1: Anchor with Research (Before the Conversation)

Before you negotiate, you need a number that's hard to argue with.

**What to research:**
1. **Industry standard for your role/location** (use Levels.fyi, Blind, PayScale)
2. **This company's typical range** (ask current employees, look at Glassdoor)
3. **Your leverage** (competing offers, unique skills, market demand)

**Example research:**
- Role: Senior Software Engineer, San Francisco
- Industry standard: $160-200K base
- Company's typical range: $155-190K
- Your leverage: 2 competing offers, specialized AI expertise, urgent need on their roadmap
- Anchor: $185K (high end of typical range, lower than your competing offers)

**Why this matters:** When you propose a number, they'll try to negotiate you down. If your anchor is high but justified, the final number will be higher.

If you anchor at $170K without research, they'll counter at $165K (their original offer). You've moved nowhere.

If you anchor at $185K with research, they'll counter at $175K. Now you're $10K ahead before you even negotiate.

### Step 2: Build Your Narrative (Before the Conversation)

This is the story you tell about why you're worth the higher number.

**The narrative has three parts:**

1. **Your unique value**
   - "I bring X skills that are hard to find"
   - Example: "AI/ML expertise, which is on your product roadmap"

2. **Market data**
   - "This is what the market pays for this profile"
   - Example: "Based on Levels.fyi and talking to peers, the range for this role is typically $175-200K in SF"

3. **Mutual benefit**
   - "This is good for both of us"
   - Example: "I'm excited about this role because [reason]. I want to make sure I'm compensated competitively so I'm fully committed to making this successful"

**Narrative example:**
"I'm really excited about this opportunity. I have 5 years in distributed systems, which directly maps to [your initiative]. I've done this at [Company] and [Company], and in the market, this profile typically commands $180-195K in SF. I'd like to find a number that works for both of us so I can commit fully. What does that look like?"

Notice: You're not asking. You're proposing a partnership.

### Step 3: The Negotiation Call (Have This Conversation Verbally)

**Timing:** 24 hours after the verbal offer (don't react immediately)

**Who:** The recruiter or hiring manager (start with recruiter if there is one)

**The opening:**
"Thanks for the offer. I'm excited about the role. I wanted to chat about the package before we finalize. You available for a quick call?"

Get them on the phone. Email is where negotiations die.

**The conversation:**

*Them:* "Great! What questions do you have?"

*You:* [Present your narrative - takes 1-2 minutes]

*Them:* "I understand where you're coming from, but that's above our budget."

*You:* (This is the critical moment)
"I understand. I've done this role at [Company] and the market data shows [range]. What flexibility do you have on base? Or if we can't move on base, what about [equity / bonus / signing bonus / PTO / title]?"

**The key phrase:** "What flexibility do you have?" (plural - this opens multiple levers)

*Them:* "Let me talk to the hiring manager and finance. Give me a day."

[They come back with a revised offer]

*Them:* "We can do $172K base + $45K bonus."

*You:* "I appreciate that. That's closer. For context, I have another offer at $180K. I'd prefer to join your team because [reason]. Is there any way to get to $175K base?"

Notice: You showed competing offer (leverage), explained why you prefer them (partnership), and asked for a specific number.

*Them:* "We can do $175K."

*You:* "Great. I'm also curious—what's typical for signing bonus and equity at this level?"

Keep negotiating across multiple dimensions.

## Real Example: How This Worked

**Scenario:** Sarah, a product manager, received an offer from a Series B startup.

**Initial offer:**
- Base: $150K
- Bonus: $30K (20%)
- Equity: 0.08%

**Her negotiation:**

**Research:**
- Market range for PM role in Denver: $145-180K
- Company's typical range: $140-175K
- Sarah's leverage: 3 years PM experience, coming from a successful exit, 1 competing offer at $165K

**Anchor:** $168K base (high end, but justified)

**Narrative:**
"I'm really excited about this role and the product direction. I bring 3 years of PM experience with a successful exit (Series A to acquisition), which is exactly what you need to scale. Based on market data, PMs with my profile in Denver typically command $160-175K base. I have another offer at $165K, but I'd prefer your team because of [reasons]. Can we find a number that works?"

**The negotiation:**

Call 1: "We can do $155K base."
Sarah: "I appreciate that. I have another offer at $165K. What flexibility do you have on base, or if not base, what about equity and signing bonus?"

Call 2: "We can do $160K base + 0.12% equity."
Sarah: "That's better. Can we also discuss signing bonus? And would the equity vest over 4 years with a 1-year cliff?"

Call 3: "Final offer: $163K base, $35K bonus, 0.15% equity, $10K signing bonus."

**Result:**
- Base: $150K → $163K (+$13K/year)
- Bonus: $30K → $35K (+$5K/year)
- Equity: 0.08% → 0.15% (+0.07%)
- Signing bonus: $0 → $10K (new)
- **Total first-year value: $180K → $208K (+$28K, 15% increase)**

**Why this worked:**
- She had competing offer (leverage)
- She researched the market (credibility)
- She negotiated across 4 dimensions (base, bonus, equity, signing bonus)
- She had a narrative (partnership, not greed)

## Red Flags That Mean You're Negotiating Wrong

❌ **You're negotiating via email.** (Gets escalated too fast, easier to say no)

❌ **You asked for a number without research.** (They'll easily shoot it down)

❌ **Your narrative is "I want more money."** (Sounds greedy, kills rapport)

❌ **You only negotiated on base.** (You left 3 other levers on the table)

❌ **You got pushed back and gave up.** ("We can't move on that" is where negotiation starts, not where it ends)

❌ **You mentioned your competing offer too early.** (Do it when they say no, not right away)

## Why This Matters Now

Companies have budget. They're not choosing between paying you $150K and going bankrupt. They're choosing how much of that budget to allocate to you.

Your job is to make the case that it should be higher.

Teams that negotiate well:
- Increase first-year offer by 15-25%
- Build better relationships with their hiring team (they respect you for advocating for yourself)
- Get better titles and perks (by not just fixating on base)
- Set themselves up better long-term (higher base = higher promotions later)

You're not being greedy. You're being smart.
