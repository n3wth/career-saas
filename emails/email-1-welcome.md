# Email 1: Welcome + Blueprint Delivery

**Subject:** Your 90-Day Career Change Blueprint is ready

---

Hi {First_Name},

Your 90-Day Career Change Blueprint is attached.

Quick intro: I'm Oliver. I've helped 200+ people change careers successfully.

Here's what I've learned: **Career changes don't take years. They take 90 focused days.**

**The blueprint you downloaded shows you exactly how.**

**How to use it:**

1. Print it out (seriously—it helps)
2. Block time in your calendar (20-30 hrs/week)
3. Start Week 1 today
4. Follow the checklist week by week

**What to expect:**

- Week 1-2: Foundation (clarity on target)
- Week 3-8: Build (portfolio projects)
- Week 7-10: Network (connections before applications)
- Week 10-14: Apply (strategic, not spray-and-pray)
- Week 12-16: Interview & offer

**Most people who follow this get offers within 16 weeks.**

**Your next step:**

Complete Week 1 exercises. Then reply to this email and tell me your target role.

I'll send you specific advice for your transition.

(I respond to every email. Promise.)

— Oliver

P.S. Tomorrow: Real story of someone who changed careers in 78 days. And how you can too.
