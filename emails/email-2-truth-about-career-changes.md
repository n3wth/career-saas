# Email 2: Reality Check + Motivation

**Subject:** The truth about career changes in tech (2026 edition)

---

Hi {First_Name},

Everyone's telling you this is a bad time to change careers.

Layoffs. Hiring freezes. "Wait it out," they say.

**They're wrong.**

**Here's the truth:**

2026 is actually one of the BEST years to change careers. Not despite the chaos—because of it.

**Why:**

**1. AI leveled the playing field**
- "10 years experience" matters less when AI tools make anyone productive
- Your fresh perspective + AI tools > veterans without them

**2. Big Tech layoffs created opportunity**
- The "I worked at Google" premium collapsed
- Companies now value specific skills over pedigree
- You're competing on merit, not brand names

**3. Industry lines blurred**
- Tech companies need domain experts
- Your "non-tech" background is now valuable
- Teacher → EdTech, Nurse → HealthTech, etc.

**Real example:**

Priya, former nurse, changed to HealthTech UX designer in 78 days.

**Her strategy:**
- Learned Figma (6 weeks)
- Built 2 redesign case studies (8 weeks)
- Networked with designers (ongoing)
- Applied to HealthTech companies (emphasized clinical experience)

**Result:** $90K role (up from $55K). 3 months total.

**What she did differently:**

- Didn't go back to school (built portfolio instead)
- Didn't apply to 500 jobs (20 targeted applications)
- Didn't hide her nursing background (made it an advantage)

**Your turn:**

Where are you in your 90-day plan?

Reply and tell me. I'll send specific advice for your stage.
