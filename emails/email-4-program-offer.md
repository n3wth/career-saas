# Email 4: Limited Offer + Urgency

**Subject:** Join our program (limited 3-day offer)

Hi {First_Name},

Final email. Promise.

You've seen the blueprint. You know it works. You've heard the success stories.

**Question: Why haven't you started?**

Let me guess:

- "I'll start next month" (you won't)
- "I'm too busy" (you'll always be busy)
- "I don't know where to start" (the blueprint tells you)
- "I'm scared" (everyone is)

**Here's the truth:**

The only difference between you and the people who successfully changed careers?

**They started.**

**So let's make this easy:**

**Join the CareerIQ Career Change Program.**

**What you get:**

- **90-Day Blueprint** (you have this)
- **Weekly 1:1 coaching** (accountability + guidance)
- **Portfolio template library** (done-for-you case study structures)
- **Community access** (400+ career changers)
- **Job leads** (exclusive opportunities)
- **Interview prep** (practice + feedback)

**Normal price:** $997

**This week only (3 days):** $497

**Why the discount?**

I'm testing this program. I need 10 success stories. You could be one.

**If you don't get an offer in 16 weeks, full refund. No questions.**

**[Enroll Now - $497 (Save $500)]**

Offer expires in 3 days.

**Or don't.**

Keep doing what you're doing. Maybe it'll work out.

But if you're serious about changing careers in 2026, this is your move.

P.S. After this, I'll stop bothering you. You'll stay on the email list for occasional insights, but no more offers. This is your shot.
