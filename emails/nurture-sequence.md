## Email 1: Welcome + Value Prop

**Subject:** Your career transition starts with clarity

Hi [Name],

Welcome to Career SaaS.

You signed up because you're thinking about a change: A new role. A career transition. A different path.

Maybe you've been laid off and need to figure out your next move. Maybe you're burned out and want something different. Maybe you see an opportunity and wonder if you can make it.

Whatever it is, you're asking: "What's next for me?"

Over the next week, I'm sharing:
- How other people made successful transitions (with real stories)
- Frameworks for planning your move (so you don't just wing it)
- Salary negotiation playbooks (so you get paid what you're worth)
- The mistakes people make (so you don't repeat them)

This isn't theory. It's battle-tested advice from 500+ people who've made tech career transitions successfully.

One quick question: **What's driving your interest in a change?**
- Laid off and exploring options
- Burned out and want something different
- Want to transition into tech
- Want to move into leadership
- Something else

Reply to this email. I read every response and it helps me send you relevant content.

## Email 2: Case Study / Social Proof

**Subject:** How a teacher became a software engineer (and made 3x salary)

Hi [Name],

Quick case study.

Sarah was a high school teacher earning $55K/year. She loved the work but hated the pay. She was burned out (twice).

At 33, she decided: "I'm going to learn to code."

She was terrified:
- "Am I too old?"
- "Can I actually learn this?"
- "Will anyone hire me?"

She did a 12-week bootcamp ($16K). Built a portfolio. Applied to 30 companies. Got 3 offers.

Took a job at a Series B startup: $130K + equity.

18 months in: Making more than double her teacher salary. Happy. Growing. No regrets.

The pattern: Career transitions are possible. They require planning, effort, and courage. But they work.

## Email 3: How-To / Educational Content

**Subject:** The 5-step framework for planning your career move

Hi [Name],

You want to make a change. Where do you start?

Most people: Update resume, apply to jobs, hope something sticks.

This rarely works. You end up back in a bad situation with a different job title.

Here's the framework we use with everyone considering a career transition:

**Step 1: Get clear on your "why"**
- Why do you want to change? (salary? impact? balance? learning?)
- This clarifies what you're actually looking for

**Step 2: Assess your financial runway**
- How much money do you have? (savings + severance)
- How much do you need monthly? (expenses)
- How many months can you survive? (runway)
- This tells you how much time you have to get strategic

**Step 3: Identify skills gaps**
- What skills does your target role need?
- What do you have? What are you missing?
- How do you close the gap? (bootcamp? courses? projects?)
- This creates your learning path

**Step 4: Build credibility**
- For career changes: build a portfolio, do projects, get a mentor
- For promotions: lead initiatives, mentor others, get visibility
- For lateral moves: understand the new area deeply
- This makes companies want to hire you

**Step 5: Execute the transition**
- Network (talk to 50+ people in your target space)
- Apply to right opportunities (not 200, but 20-30 that fit)
- Negotiate (you have more leverage than you think)
- This gets you the offer

We put together a full planning checklist: [Download the transition checklist](#)

Use it this week. It'll clarify a lot.

## Email 5: Final CTA + Guarantee

**Subject:** Your career transition starts this week

Hi [Name],

This is the last email in the sequence.

If you've made it this far, you're serious about your next move.

Maybe you resonated with Sarah's bootcamp story. Maybe the 5-step framework helped. Maybe you're just curious about what's possible.

Here's what we know: Career transitions work. They work especially well when you have a clear plan and someone to help you execute it.

Most people don't plan. They react. They apply to jobs that don't fit. They negotiate poorly. They end up back in a bad situation.

The people who win are the ones who plan strategically.
