# Email Sequence 2: Visibility Story (Day 3)

Subject: Why you're stuck (and how to break through)

Body:

Hi [Name],

You're probably feeling something like this:

❌ I'm doing good work but nobody important notices
❌ I shipped features but didn't get credit  
❌ My manager gets the promotion I deserved
❌ Better opportunities aren't coming my way

You're not lazy. You're not incompetent. You're INVISIBLE.

Here's the data: 80% of career growth isn't about being better. It's about being KNOWN.

The people who get promoted aren't always the best. They're often just the most visible to decision-makers.

I'll show you exactly how to become visible (without being annoying or self-promoting):

✅ Document your impact (in a way that reaches leadership)
✅ Take high-visibility projects (the ones that get noticed)
✅ Present your work (5 min at all-hands, quarterly)
✅ Build relationships (1:1 with your executive sponsor)

In 90 days, people know your name. In 120 days, opportunities follow.

# Email Sequence 3: Raise Negotiation (Day 7)

Subject: How to negotiate a raise (without leaving)

Body:

Hi [Name],

Most people think you need to threaten to leave to get a raise.

You don't.

Here's the framework that works:

**4 weeks before:** Tell your manager "I want to discuss compensation in 4 weeks. I'll prepare market data and impact analysis."

**2 weeks before:** Share your document showing market rates + your impact.

**1 week before:** Manager talks to leadership. You get feedback.

**Week 1:** Get the offer (usually higher than you asked).

The key? You're giving them notice and making their job easy. You're not demanding. You're professional.

Average raise using this framework: 24%
