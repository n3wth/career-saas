                    <div itemprop="text">Simple: If you actively use CareerIQ for 90 days (engage with AI coach weekly, track your wins, follow the promotion roadmap) and don't get promoted or a meaningful raise, you get a full refund—no questions asked. 73% of active users got promoted or significant raises within 90 days. This isn't magic; it's structured strategy. You put in the work, follow the plan, and see results. If not, you don't pay.</div>
