# Compensation Audit Template
## Find Money You're Losing (And Fix It)

Use this template to audit your compensation gaps and identify opportunities to improve retention.

## Part 1: Internal Compensation Audit

### Setup
1. Export your HRIS data: Role, Tenure, Performance Rating, Salary, Location
2. Remove PII from names (keep employee IDs only)
3. Create columns for analysis

### Analysis Template

| Employee ID | Role | Tenure (yrs) | Performance | Salary | Market Rate | Gap | Flag |
|-------------|------|-------------|-------------|--------|-------------|-----|------|
| E001 | Senior PM | 5 | 4/5 | $180K | $195K | -$15K | ✅ Raise |
| E002 | Senior PM | 3 | 3/5 | $195K | $185K | +$10K | 📍 Monitor |
| E003 | Mid PM | 2 | 5/5 | $130K | $145K | -$15K | ⚠️ RISK |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Interpretation:**
- **✅ Raise:** Underpaid vs. market, strong performance → compensation risk
- **📍 Monitor:** Overpaid slightly, but performance makes sense
- **⚠️ RISK:** Underpaid + performance risk = likely to leave

### Quick Analysis Questions

1. **Are high performers underpaid?**
   - Filter: Performance 4-5 rating AND Salary < Market - $10K
   - Result: These people are leaving. Fix immediately.

2. **Is there salary compression?**
   - Compare: Junior vs Mid vs Senior salaries
   - Healthy: 15-25% spread between levels
   - Unhealthy: < 10% spread (people feel undifferentiated)

3. **Are tenure/experience reflected in pay?**
   - Compare: Year 1-2 employees vs 5+ year employees
   - Healthy: 5-10% raises per year
   - Unhealthy: No correlation to tenure (demoralizing)

4. **Is there gender/demographic salary gap?**
   - Compare: Same role, similar performance
   - Target: <5% variance (anything else is a problem)

5. **Who's at retention risk?**
   - Filter: Salary < Market - $15K
   - Flag: These will get recruited by competitors

## Part 2: Market Benchmarking

### Data Sources (Free)
1. **Levels.fyi** - Tech salary data by level/role/location
2. **Salary.com** - Broad market benchmarks
3. **PayScale** - Historical data by company size
4. **LinkedIn Salary** - Public salary ranges by role

### Benchmarking Template

| Role | Location | Your Salary | Market Rate | Percentile | Gap |
|------|----------|------------|-------------|-----------|-----|
| Senior PM | San Francisco | $180K | $200K | 45th | -$20K |
| Senior PM | New York | $175K | $195K | 40th | -$20K |
| Mid PM | San Francisco | $130K | $145K | 35th | -$15K |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Interpretation:**
- **45th percentile:** You're competitive but slightly below market
- **35th percentile:** You're losing people to competitors
- **>60th percentile:** You're paying premium (either location-specific or needed for retention)

## Part 3: Retention Risk Scoring

### Risk Factors (Score 1-5)

| Factor | Description | Your Score |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Compensation** | Salary gap vs market | _/5 |
| **Performance** | Recent review score | _/5 |
| **Tenure** | Years with company (5+ year employees higher risk) | _/5 |
| **Growth** | Promotion timeline (2+ years stuck = high risk) | _/5 |
| **External Demand** | Role market competitiveness | _/5 |

**Score calculation:** (Compensation + Performance + Tenure + Growth + External Demand) / 5

**Interpretation:**
- **4-5:** HIGH RISK - Likely to be recruited soon
- **3-3.9:** MEDIUM RISK - Vulnerable if competitor approaches
- **2-2.9:** LOW RISK - Likely to stay
- **<2:** VERY LOW RISK - Locked in

### Action by Risk Level

**HIGH RISK (4-5):**
- Have career conversation THIS WEEK
- Offer market-rate compensation adjustment
- Discuss growth path and next promotion
- Understand what they want next
- Consider retention bonus if deserved

**MEDIUM RISK (3-3.9):**
- Schedule coffee chat (quarterly)
- Understand career goals
- Create development plan
- Monitor market feedback
- Prepare compensation adjustment if needed

**LOW RISK (2-2.9):**
- Regular 1:1 check-ins
- Quarterly career conversations
- Annual benchmarking

**VERY LOW RISK (<2):**
- Focus on career development
- Annual check-ins

## Red Flags in Your Audit

❌ **Top performers underpaid vs market** → Retention crisis incoming  
❌ **New hires earning more than tenured employees** → Demoralizing  
❌ **Compensation doesn't correlate to performance** → No incentive to excel  
❌ **You have no idea what market rates are** → Flying blind  
❌ **You haven't raised anyone in 2+ years** → People are leaving  

## Expected Results (3 Months After Implementation)

- **Retention of flagged employees:** +40-60%
- **Salary gap reduced:** 15-25%
- **Team morale:** +30%
- **Recruitment difficulty:** -50% (better positioning)
- **Cost:** Typically 2-4% of salary budget

That's a huge ROI on retention.
