## The Exact Words to Use When Negotiating Your Next Offer

---

## Pre-Negotiation Preparation

### Know Your Numbers

**Your target salary:** $_______
**Your minimum acceptable:** $_______
**Market rate for role:** $_______

**Research sources:**
- Levels.fyi (tech)
- Glassdoor
- Blind
- H1B database

---

## The Negotiation Sequence

### Phase 1: When They Ask "What's Your Salary Expectation?"

**❌ Don't say:**
- "I'm making $X now, so..."
- "I'm flexible"
- "Whatever's fair"

**✅ Say instead:**

"I'm focused on finding the right fit first. Once we're both excited about the role, I'm confident we can land on fair compensation. What range did you have in mind for this role?"

**Goal:** Make them name a number first.

---

### Phase 2: When They Make the Initial Offer

**Don't say yes immediately** (even if it's great).

**✅ Response:**

"Thanks for the offer! I'm excited about the role and [company]. I'd like to take 24-48 hours to review the full package and get back to you. Is that okay?"

**Why:** Gives you time to research, think, and prepare counter.

---

### Phase 3: The Counter-Offer

**When the initial offer is below your target:**

**✅ Script:**

"Thank you for the offer. I'm really excited about this opportunity and [specific reason].

Based on my research and the scope of this role, I was expecting compensation in the range of $[X-Y]. 

Given my [specific value you bring], I'd like to discuss whether we can get closer to $[target].

What's possible here?"

**Key elements:**
- Express enthusiasm (you want the job)
- Provide reasoning (market data + value)
- Ask what's possible (collaborative tone)

---

### Phase 4: If They Can't Meet Your Number

**✅ Explore other levers:**

"I understand there may be constraints on base salary. Can we look at:

- **Sign-on bonus:** Would a $[X] signing bonus be possible to bridge the gap?

- **Performance bonus:** What's the target bonus for this role? Can we increase that?

- **Equity:** Can we increase the equity grant?

- **Earlier review:** Would you consider an early review (3-6 months) with potential for adjustment?

- **Other benefits:** Remote flexibility? PTO? Learning budget?"

**Goal:** Get creative if they're stuck on base.

---

## Specific Scenarios

### Scenario 1: They Low-Ball You

**Their offer:** 20% below market

**✅ Response:**

"I appreciate the offer. However, based on market data for this role and my [X years experience / specific skills], the range I'm seeing is $[X-Y].

Given that, I'd need to be at least at $[minimum] to move forward.

Is there flexibility here?"

---

### Scenario 2: They Say "This Is Our Final Offer"

**✅ Response:**

"I understand. Before I give you my final answer, can you help me understand:

- Is there any flexibility on [sign-on bonus / equity / bonus]?
- What would it take to get to $[your target]?
- When is the next compensation review?"

**Then:** Decide if you can accept or walk.

---

### Scenario 3: You Have Multiple Offers

**✅ Leverage script:**

"I'm excited about this opportunity. I want to be transparent—I'm also considering an offer from [Company B] at $[their offer].

However, [Your Company] is my top choice because [genuine reason].

Is there any way we can get closer to that range? I'd love to accept your offer if we can."

**This works IF:**
- You're genuinely interested in them
- You have a real competing offer
- You're prepared to walk if they don't budge

---

### Scenario 4: Career Change (Lower Than Current Salary)

**When transitioning careers, you might take a pay cut.**

**✅ Frame it:**

"I understand this role is a career change for me. I'm comfortable with [reasonable adjustment], but $[their offer] is below what I can accept.

Given my [transferable skills], could we meet at $[reasonable target]?"

**Don't undersell yourself 40% just because you're changing.**

---

## After You Accept

**✅ Get it in writing:**

"Thanks for agreeing to $[X salary] + [equity/bonus]. Can you send the updated offer letter reflecting this? I'd like to review before I formally accept."

**Don't resign current job until you have written offer.**

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Accepting First Offer

❌ "Great, I'll take it!"
✅ Always negotiate (even if you're happy)

### Mistake 2: Revealing Current Salary

❌ "I make $100K now"
✅ "I'm looking for market rate for this role"

### Mistake 3: Not Knowing Your Walk-Away Number

❌ Negotiating with no bottom line
✅ Know minimum acceptable before talks

### Mistake 4: Being Apologetic

❌ "Sorry to ask, but..."
✅ "I'd like to discuss compensation"

### Mistake 5: Negotiating Over Email (When Possible)

❌ Email-only negotiation
✅ Phone/video call (harder to say no)
