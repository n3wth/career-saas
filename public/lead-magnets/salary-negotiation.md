## Complete Salary Negotiation Framework

### Before You Interview

**Know your numbers:**
- Market rate for your role/experience: $___
- Minimum acceptable: $___
- Stretch goal: $___

**Sources:**
- Levels.fyi (specific company data)
- Blind Community (verified employee salaries)
- LinkedIn (peer profiles)
- Payscale.com

### During Interviews

**When asked "What salary are you looking for?"**

Never answer with a number first.

Instead: "I'm flexible on compensation if the role is right. I'm interested in learning more about the role, team, and company. That said, based on market rates for similar positions, I'd expect something in the range of $X-Y. What's your budget for this role?"

### The Offer

You received an offer: $150K base, $50K stock, $10K signing bonus

**First move:** Don't accept immediately
- "Thank you. I appreciate the offer. I'd like to review it and get back to you within 2 business days."
- Take the time. Think.

**Second move:** Identify gaps
- Is base salary on par? (if market is $160K, this is low)
- Is stock vesting standard? (4-year vesting is standard)
- Is signing bonus standard for your level?
- Are benefits competitive?

### Negotiation Levers

If base salary is low, negotiate on:

1. **Base salary increase**
   "I appreciate the offer. Based on market rates for my experience, I'd feel better at $160K base. Can we move there?"

2. **Signing bonus increase**
   "Can we increase the signing bonus to $20K? That helps with transition costs."

3. **Stock increase**
   "Can we increase the equity to $75K? That would align with similar roles."

4. **Bonus**
   "Is there a performance bonus? If so, what's the target?"

5. **Non-monetary**
   - Remote flexibility
   - Extra PTO
   - Learning budget
   - Flexible hours

### The Response

Company: "Our budget is $150K. We can't go higher."

Your response: "I understand you have constraints. I'm interested in working here. What if we structured it differently?"

Options:
- "Could we start at $150K with a review in 6 months with a bump to $160K if I'm performing?"
- "Could we increase stock from $50K to $75K?"
- "Could we add $15K signing bonus?"

One of these usually works.

### The Golden Rule

**Walk away if:**
- The offer is significantly below market
- The company won't budge on anything
- You have other strong options

**It's okay to negotiate. Companies expect it.**
