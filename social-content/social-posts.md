## Stat-Based Posts

### Post 1: Bootcamp Outcomes
"85% of bootcamp graduates get jobs within 6 months. Average salary: $85K (vs. $55K career switchers starting salaries). Bootcamp ROI: $16K investment, $15K+ salary lift per year. Not a get-rich-quick scheme, but a solid investment in your future. [Read the data](#)"

### Post 2: Career Transition Timing
"70% of successful career transitions happen within 12 months of planning. Why? Because clarity creates momentum. When you know what you want and why, you move faster. No clarity = 2-3 years of wandering. [How to get clarity](#)"

### Post 3: Negotiation Impact
"Average negotiation: +$10K-15K in salary. That's $100K-150K over 10 years. Yet 30% of people don't negotiate at all. Money left on the table out of fear. [Negotiation playbook here](#)"

### Post 4: Bootcamps Aren't Magic
"Bootcamps get hyped. Truth: Bootcamps are hard. Not everyone finishes. Not everyone gets a job. The people who win are disciplined, keep learning, and target the right opportunities. Bootcamp is the start, not the finish line."

### Post 5: Layoffs Aren't Disasters
"Everyone treats layoffs like career disasters. Wrong. Layoffs are often the best thing that happens to careers. Why? Freedom to be strategic instead of comfortable. You finally ask: What do I actually want? [How to use a layoff as leverage](#)"

### Post 6: Experience Overrated
"Companies say 'We need 5+ years experience.' Then they hire bootcamp grads. What actually matters: Can you solve problems? Can you learn? Are you coachable? Experience is just a proxy for these things."

### Post 7: Marcus's Story
"Marcus was a software engineer for 7 years. Good salary. Unfulfilled. He transitioned to PM. First offer was $160K base (down $20K from engineering). 18 months later: Senior PM at $200K+. Career trajectories change when you move intentionally."

### Post 8: The Layoff Reframe
"She got laid off. First instinct: panic. Second instinct: opportunity. She took 2 weeks off. Reflected on what she wanted. Negotiated hard. Landed a better job, 35% more pay, 3x better team. Layoff wasn't disaster. It was catalyst."
